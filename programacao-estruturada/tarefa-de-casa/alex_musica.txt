Heavy Metal {

Watch the vultures as they open their eyes
Can you please, please give them something
Play the heavens with the devil's dice
Can you serve them, feed 'em with your king
You've never seen anything like this before
You will never see a clockwork sunrise no more
I will deny you
This world belongs to me
You try to fake it
But all wounds are there to see
