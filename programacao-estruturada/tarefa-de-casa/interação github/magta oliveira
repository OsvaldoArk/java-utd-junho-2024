don't tell me

You held my hand and walked me home, I know
While you gave me that kiss you were something like this
It made me go, oh, oh
You wiped my tears got rid of all my fears
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that
Girl, the one who gives it all away, yeah?
