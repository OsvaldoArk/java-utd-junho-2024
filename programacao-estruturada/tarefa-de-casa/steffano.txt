WIND OF CHANGE



I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers?
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me
To the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change

Hum-mm

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva and down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me (take me)
To the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing what my guitar wants to say (say)

Take me (take me)
To the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)
